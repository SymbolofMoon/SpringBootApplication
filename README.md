# SpringBootApplication

Introducing SynchronyImgurRESTApp, a REST Application for allow users to register, authenticate, and manage images. 
This project is designed and developed in order to integrate with Imgur API to upload, view, and delete images while associating them with the user profile.

## Functional Requirements
-  Register users with basic information, including a username and password.
-  After user authentication, allow image upload, viewing, and deletion.
-  Each user can have an associated list of images.
-  User authentication will be managed using a username and password stored in an in-memory H2 database.
-  The application should log important events and errors.
-  JUnit test cases must be implemented.

## NonFunctional Requirements
-  Spring Boot 3.x.x framework
-  JDK 17 or lower
-  H2 Database (in-memory for storing user information)
-  Imgur API Integration for image operations
-  Security
-  Scalable

## Bonus Points
-  Secure API via oAuth2
-  Optimize API for 100K RPM
-  Establish CI/CD Pipeline (feel free to use open-source tools)
-  Create a messaging event that publishes the username and the image name to a Messaging Platform (Ex: Kafka)
    & feel free to connect with a local or cloud instance of the Messaging Platform.
-  Preferably following the TDD approach for Junit test cases

## Database Schema
-  We are using H2(In Memory Database) as given in the requirement
-  There are two relational tables which are as follows:
    -  User
        -  id: Generated ID
        -  username: Unique Parameter
        -  password: Storing password in encrypted form with the help of Bcrypt
        -  email: Unique Parameter
        -  List<Image>images: List of images and OnetoMany relations
    -  Image
        -  id: Generated ID
        -  imgurId: Id that ImgurAPI generates
        -  imgurLink: The Image link that is uploaded to Imgur
        -  imgurDeleteHash: The delete hash used to delete the image in Imgur
        -  imgurName: The name of the file that is uploaded

## API Endpoints
- User Management
    - POST /api/users/register: Registers a user with username and password and basic information.
    - GET /api/users/profile: Retrieves user basic information and image list(authenticated request)
    - POST /api/users/login: Authenticates user based on username and password
    - POST /api/users/logout: Logout the current user
- Image Management
    - POST /api/users/upload: Upload an image to Imgur (authenticated request)
    - GET /api/users/images/{imageId}:: View a specific image associated with the user (authenticated request)
    - DELETE /api/users/images/{imageId}: Deletes a specific image from Imgur (authenticated request)

## High Level System Design

**This System is based on how a client app can handle crud activities for 3rd Party App. The flow behind the app is**
 - The user Will Register through our App and the information will be stored in the h2 database
 - User Login through our app using username and password. In exchange, our app will send the user a JWT token which will be set as a cookie on the client side.
 - Whenever a user tries to upload, get or view an image, our client sends a request with that cookie. Our server extracts the token, validates the token, and authenticates the user to perform the operations. 
 - The corresponding request for metadata of the image are also updated in our database.
 - If the Server cannot verify the token, it will declare the client as an unauthorized user.
 - If user choose to logout, the Cookie is Deleted at client side.
 - The expiry time of cookie is 1 hour.
